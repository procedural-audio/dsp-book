# DSP Book

Herein lies the prototype book on DSP algorithms. I'll fill this out as I learn about them. 

### Ideas
 - Have a chapter on each major kind of algorithm

### Distribution
 - Create a derivative metasampler app
   - Sidebar for the table of contents
   - Each chapter is rendered as markdown
   - Beside each chapter, show an interactive block diagram of the DSP algorithm
 - Distribute a pdf version
 - Distirbute a version on Amazon

 ### Algorithms
  - **Dynamics**: Analog compressor
  - **Space**: Reverb, shimmer, delay
  - **Distortion**: Saturation, distortion, exciter, amp
  - **Filter**: Analog filter, creative filter
  - **Synthesis**: Vital wavetable oscillators, additive synth technique in JUCE talk, polygon synthesis
  - **Granular**: Microsound algorithms
  - **Special**: Sample resynthesis, physical modelling
