# DSP Book

Herein lies the prototype book on DSP algorithms. I'll fill this out as I learn about them. 

### Ideas
 - Have a chapter on each major kind of algorithm
 - Program a version of each algorithm using the metasampler DSP language, faust, or rust
 - Theme the book like my website
 - Distribute a version on Amazon

### Distribution
 - Create a derivative metasampler app
   - Sidebar for the table of contents
   - Each chapter is rendered as markdown
   - Beside each chapter, show an interactive block diagram of the DSP algorithm
