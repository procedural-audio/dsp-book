# DSP Book

Herein lies the prototype book on DSP algorithms. I'll fill this out as I learn about them. 

### Ideas
 - Have a chapter on each major kind of algorithm
 - Program a version of each algorithm using the metasampler DSP language, faust, or rust
 - Theme the book like my website
 - Distribute a version on Amazon
